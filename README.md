## Venue
The workshop will take place at Newcastle University, at the Armstrong Building room 2.96. A map of its location and a selection of nearby places to eat lunch is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TpqYGzLsH5wJwcvjHabIa6kWtRy_o9LL&usp=sharing).

The room is equipped with computers, so you will not need to bring laptops. (Although you may do so if you want.) Eduroam WiFi is available if you have registered for this at your home institution, we will not be providing any other WiFi accounts.

## Travel
The university provides maps and much more detailed travel information [on this page](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/who-we-are/contact/maps/).

**By car**: If you are coming by car, be aware that parking in Newcastle city centre is difficult and we recommend you secure this at your hotel. We encourage use of public transport if possible.

**By train**: If arriving by train, the venue is about a 20 minute walk from Newcastle Central Station. Taxis are available at the station. There is also a metro (‘Central’ station) at the train station from which you can go two stops to ‘Haymarket’ station which is adjacent to the University.

**By Metro**: Get off at the ‘Haymarket’ station which is adjacent to the University.

**By Air**: If you are flying, then fly to Newcastle (NCL), and take the metro directly from the airport to Haymarket station (or the station closest to your hotel).
